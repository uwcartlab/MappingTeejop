//This code was written in the Summer of 2022, in a place known to the Ho-Chunk people as Teejop (four lakes).                                                                                  //
//The Ho-Chunk were forced to cede Teejop by an 1832 treaty as Euro-Ameircan settlers founded a city called Madison, Wisconsin.                                                                 //
//Over the following decades, the federal and state governments attemped an unsuccessful ethnic cleansing campaign against the Ho-Chunk, who struggled for decades to remain in their homelands.//
//This code was written by Gareth Baldrica-Franklin, a settle living in Teejop.                                                                                                                //

                    <p><b>Mapping Teejop</b> is a digital mapping project that guides users on Indigenous walking tours of the UW-Madison campus, created in partnership between the American Indian & Indigenous Studies Program and the Department of Geography’s Cartography Lab. Mapping Teejop provides content and context for visitors to learn about Ho-Chunk and Native history and presence at the University of Wisconsin, a region long known as Teejop, and also opportunities for critical and self-reflection. The tours feature some of the most iconic locations on campus, Bascom Hill, Observatory Hill, <b class='pronounce'>Tee Wąąkšik Homįk</b> (Lake Mendota), Camp Randal, and the Memorial Union. <p>
                    <p>Mapping Teejop is intended to be an entry point into learning and reflecting on the Indigenous history and presence of the UW campus. For visitors wanting a more in-depth experience with in-person tour guides, please consider the First Nations Cultural Landscape Tour by visiting the Visitor Relations and Campus Tours website, found <a href="https://info.wisc.edu/campus-tours/">here</a>.</p>

                        Citizen Potawatomi Nation (Oklahoma). Keeler’s work centers federal Indian policy, American
                        Indian land and property ownership, histories of place and placemaking, dispossession,
                        (sub)urbanization, and public memory. Her first book, American Indians and the American Dream:
                        Policies, Place, and Property in Minnesota was published in 2023.</p>

                    <p><b>Gareth Baldrica-Franklin</b> is a PhD student in Geography at UW. He studies a variety of map-related
                        topics, informed by Indigenous, feminist, and critical scholarship—including the relationship
                        between mapmaking and storytelling, and how maps could be used to connect us more deeply to
                        our landscape. In addition to Mapping Teejop, Gareth has worked on Global Madison, an educational
                        walking tour designed to teach students about globalization, and he is currently working on a project
                        with Dr. Keeler connecting the Homestead Act to Indigenous dispossession. He is of settler
