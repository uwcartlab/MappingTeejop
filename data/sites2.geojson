Non-Native protestors often resorted to the use of provocative signage featuring violent slogans such as \u201cSave a walleye, spear an Indian\u201d and on more than one occasion Native fishers were assaulted by protestors.<sup>2</sup> The significant tension surrounding the reaffirmed practice of treaty rights led to frequent open expressions of anti-Native sentiment. It is in this context that Swamp was invited to campus to plant a Tree of Peace, which would \u201cencourage unity and environmental stewardship\u201d and \u201cremind[s us about caring for one another and caring for the environment.\u201d<sup>3</sup> Though many tensions still remain within in Wisconsin regarding the ongoing practice of Ojibwe treaty fishing rights, the Tree of Peace stands on campus to \u201cprovide us comfort\u201d and everyone is invited to visit the tree when in need."

The US-Dakota War, which unfolded during the US Civil War, was a direct result of settler encroachment on tribal lands and the failure of the federal government to honor treaty obligations.<sup>1</sup> After the six-week war across southern Minnesota, hundreds of Dakota and fifteen Ho-Chunk men faced trial for their participation.<sup>2</sup> Abraham Lincoln, whose likeness is enshrined on Bascom Hill, approved a list of 38 Dakota men to be hanged for their \u201cwar crimes,\u201d resulting in the largest mass execution in US history.

Originally comprising 53\u00bd acres and owned by the estate of William D. Bruen, the tract was leased to the State Agricultural Society in 1859. When war came in April 1861, the land was turned over to the state as a military training rendezvous and Camp Randall became the state's largest staging point. A hospital and a stockade for Confederate prisoners of war were also located here. Purchased by the state in 1893, the land was deeded to the University of Wisconsin. Since that time, a portion of the grounds has been used as an athletic field. As a memorial to Wisconsin's Civil War soldiers, a small segment of the land was set aside as a Park and the Memorial Arch was completed in 1912.

Driven by worry about rapid industrialization and increased population density in urban areas and largely championed by wealthy Americans, the City Beautiful movement articulated a need for conscientious urban planning that supported diverse projects to improve the quality of urban life. Among these projects were the establishment of public parks, parkways, and altered shorelines. These public lands projects purported to benefit society at large. After all, the idea of accessible, shared green space that belongs to everyone is, on the surface, a generally good idea.  "

By working to \u201cimprove\u201d lands for the creation of public space, Ho-Chunk practices on and of these lands (including land management of this area\u2019s natural wetlands) were foreclosed. While City Beautiful urban planning sought to improve lands in accordance with settler colonial Progressive Era preferences, the question of accessibility remained for Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples alike. Who was allowed to use public space like Vilas Park? And for what purpose? What was permissible? What was figuratively or literally criminal? These questions remain just as pertinent today as they did in the early 20th century."
