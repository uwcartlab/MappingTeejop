This symbol is the crest of the Union. It represents the unity of the Union and the diversity of the people who are part of the Union.”<sup>3</sup> A similar crest is laid into the floor of the Union’s main entrance as well. Despite this official origin of the Union crest, it is difficult to not conflate the Union crest with the Pipe of Peace Ceremony and American Indian appropriation, both of which complicate the history of Ho-Chunk dispossession from this very land."

Though highly romanticized, these murals depict a familiar erasure and replacement narrative through story. Much of present-day northern Wisconsin, land that had long been home to Ojibwe, Menominee, and Potawatomi, had rich forests that had been managed for millennia by tribal nations.<sup>2</sup> When Euro-American loggers arrived to the region during the mid-nineteenth century, this would rapidly change as valuable timber rich land left Native hands and timber reserves were logged for the profit of white businessmen, further fueling non-Native settlement.
