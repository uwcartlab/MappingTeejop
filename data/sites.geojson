As one enters the Memorial Union from the main entrance, up the flight of stairs that face Langdon Street, you may notice the doorknobs to the Union emblazoned with “a shield with a peace pipe behind it. This symbol is the crest of the Union. It represents the unity of the Union and the diversity of the people who are part of the Union.”<sup>3</sup> A similar crest is laid into the floor of the Union’s main entrance as well. Despite this official origin of the Union crest, it is difficult to not conflate the Union crest with the Pipe of Peace Ceremony and American Indian appropriation, both of which complicate the history of Ho-Chunk dispossession from this very land."

Though highly romanticized, these murals depict a familiar erasure and replacement narrative through story.
