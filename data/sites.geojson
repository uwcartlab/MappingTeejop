It is in this context that Swamp was invited to campus to plant a Tree of Peace, which would “encourage unity and environmental stewardship” and “remind[s] us about caring for one another and caringfor the environment.”<sup>3</sup> Though many tensions still remain within in Wisconsin regarding the ongoing practice of Ojibwe treaty fishing rights, the Tree of Peace stands on campus to “provide us comfort” and everyone is invited to visit the tree when in need."

The US-Dakota War, which unfolded during the US Civil War, was a direct result of settler encroachment on tribal lands and the failure of the federal government to honor treaty obligations.<sup>1</sup> After the six-week war across southern Minnesota, hundreds of Dakota and fifteen Ho-Chunk men faced trial for their participation.<sup>2</sup> Abraham Lincoln, whose likeness is enshrined on Bascom Hill, approved a list of 38 Dakota men to be hanged for their “war crimes,” resulting in the largest mass execution in US history.

Despite the deaths of Dakota non-combatants, including women, children, and elders, no military personnel were charged or tried for their war crimes.<sup>3</sup>"

Camp Randall previously served intermittently as the former location of the Wisconsin State Fairgrounds throughout the nineteenth century. During the fair in 1885, one of the highlights of the event was an exhibition lacrosse game performed by Natives in colorful regalia with traditionally constructed equipment. On September 9th, two integrated teams consisting of thirty-eight Bad River Band Ojibwe and nine Red Cliff Band Ojibwe men competed in what the Wisconsin State Journal called a “wildly picturesque” game of lacrosse.<sup>1</sup> Despite unexpected storms deterring many spectators, the event still drew a crowd of around 2000 people."
