It is in this context that Swamp was invited to campus to plant a Tree of Peace, which would “encourage unity and environmental stewardship” and “remind[s] us about caring for one another and caringfor the environment.”<sup>3</sup> Though many tensions still remain within in Wisconsin regarding the ongoing practice of Ojibwe treaty fishing rights, the Tree of Peace stands on campus to “provide us comfort” and everyone is invited to visit the tree when in need."

Many American Indian communities have traditionally engaged in various forms of gaming, and tribal nations maintain inherent authority over the regulation of gaming on their lands. In 1988, Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that works to regulate tribal gaming, including how gaming profits may be used.<sup>1</sup> The Ho-Chunk Nation has experienced significant financial benefits from the formation of Ho-Chunk Gaming, but many people in Wisconsin have come to conflate the sovereign Ho-Chunk Nation with the business Ho-Chunk Gaming.

More than 70,000 men trained for service within the boundaries of this camp named after Alexander W. Randall, a wartime governor. Originally comprising 53½ acres and owned by the estate of William D. Bruen, the tract was leased to the State Agricultural Society in 1859. When war came in April 1861, the land was turned over to the state as a military training rendezvous and Camp Randall became the state's largest staging point. A hospital and a stockade for Confederate prisoners of war were also located here. Purchased by the state in 1893, the land was deeded to the University of Wisconsin. Since that time, a portion of the grounds has been used as an athletic field. As a memorial to Wisconsin's Civil War soldiers, a small segment of the land was set aside as a Park and the Memorial Arch was completed in 1912.

On September 9th, two integrated teams consisting of thirty-eight Bad River Band Ojibwe and nine Red Cliff Band Ojibwe men competed in what the Wisconsin State Journal called a “wildly picturesque” game of lacrosse.<sup>1</sup> Despite unexpected storms deterring many spectators, the event still drew a crowd of around 2000 people."

Leopold described his goal of UW Arboretum land re-creating “what Dane County looked like when our ancestors arrived here during the 1840s.”<sup>1</sup> Acknowledging the value of restoration, and later writing about mutual beneficence with the land, he did not make a connection between the landscape in the 1840s, at the time of initial Euro-American settlement, and the Ho-Chunk people who had stewarded the land since time immemorial."

Instead, creative solutions are being explored—particularly planting native species around trimmed buckthorn in attempt to out-compete the invader.
