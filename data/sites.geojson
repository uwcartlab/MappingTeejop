Non-Native protestors often resorted to the use of provocative signage featuring violent slogans such as “Save a walleye, spear an Indian” and on more than one occasion Native fishers were assaulted by protestors.<sup>2</sup> The significant tension surrounding the reaffirmed practice of treaty rights led to frequent open expressions of anti-Native sentiment. It is in this context that Swamp was invited to campus to plant a Tree of Peace, which would “encourage unity and environmental stewardship” and “remind[s] us about caring for one another and caringfor the environment.”<sup>3</sup> Though many tensions still remain within in Wisconsin regarding the ongoing practice of Ojibwe treaty fishing rights, the Tree of Peace stands on campus to “provide us comfort” and everyone is invited to visit the tree when in need. Just be mindful of the bird and two-tailed water spirit mounds nearby!"
